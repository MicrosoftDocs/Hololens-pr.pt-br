# Enroll HoloLens in MDM

You can manage multiple Microsoft HoloLens devices simultaneously using solutions like [Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/windows-holographic-for-business). You will be able to manage settings, select apps to install and set security configurations tailored to your organization's need. Consulte [Gerenciar dispositivos que executam o Windows Holographic com o Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/windows-holographic-for-business), os [provedores de serviço de configuração (CSPs) que têm suporte no Windows Holographic](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/customize/mdm/configuration-service-provider-reference#hololens) e as [políticas compatíveis com o Windows Holographic for Business](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/commercialize/customize/mdm/policy-configuration-service-provider#hololenspolicies).

> [!NOTE]
> Gerenciamento de dispositivo móvel (MDM), incluindo a VPN, Bitlocker e recursos do modo de quiosque, só estão disponíveis quando você [faz upgrade para o Windows Holographic for Business](hololens1-upgrade-enterprise.md).

## Requirements

 Your organization will need to have Mobile Device Management (MDM) set up in order to manage HoloLens devices. Your MDM provider can be Microsoft Intune or a 3rd party provider that uses Microsoft MDM APIs.
 
## Different ways to enroll

Depending on the type of identity chosen either during OOBE or post sign-in there are different methods of enrollment. To learn more about each type of Identity on HoloLens please visit [this page](hololens-identity.md).

- If Identity is AAD, then either during OOBE or **Settings App** -> **Access Work or School** -> **Connect** button.
    - For AAD, automatic MDM enrollment only occurs if AAD has been configured with enrollment URLs.
- If Identity is AAD and device has been pre-registered with Intune MDM server with specific configuration profile assigned to it, then AAD-Join and enrollment will automatically occur during OOBE.
    - Also called [Autopilot flow](hololens2-autopilot.md) Available in [19041.1103+ builds](hololens-release-notes.md#windows-holographic-version-2004).
- If Identity is MSA, then using **Settings App** -> **Access Work or School** -> **Connect** button.
    - Also called Add Work Account (AWA) flow.
- If Identity is Local User, then using **Settings App** -> **Access Work or School** -> **Enroll only in device management** link.
    - Also called pure MDM enrollment flow.

Once the device is enrolled with your MDM server, the Settings app will now reflect that the device is enrolled in device management.

## Auto-enrollment in MDM

Se a organização usar o Azure AD (Azure Active Directory) e uma solução MDM que aceita um token AAD para autenticação (atualmente, compatível apenas no Microsoft Intune e no AirWatch), o administrador de TI poderá configurar o Azure AD para permitir automaticamente o registro no MDM depois que o usuário entrar usando a conta do Azure AD. [Saiba como configurar o registro do Azure AD.](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enroll#enable-windows-10-automatic-enrollment)

Quando o registro automático está habilitado, nenhum registro manual adicional é necessário. When the user signs in with an Azure AD account, the device is enrolled in MDM after completing the first-run experience.

When a device is AAD Joined it may affect who considered the [device owner](security-adminless-os.md#device-owner).

## Unenroll HoloLens from Intune
